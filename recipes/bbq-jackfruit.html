    <img src="../img/bbq-jackfruit-img.jpeg">
    <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>Exactly what you've been waiting for... a deliciously and conspicuously vegan version of the fan favorite. Has the texture of pulled pork, without the ethical implications. All served on a bed of crispy fresh coleslaw (fries optional but recommended).</p>
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>two 20-ounce cans of jackfruit, rinsed and drained</li>
            <li>1 tsp vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1/2 sweet onion, chopped</li>
            <li>2 tbsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 cup BBQ sauce of choice, divided</li>
            <li>1 tbsp cornstarch</li>
        </ul> 
      <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Tear the jackfruit into shreds.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, mix together 1/2 cup of BBQ sauce and cornstarch. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Cook the onions until translucent in a shallow pan over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Add the jackfruit, soy sauce, and remaining 1/2 cup of BBQ sauce. Cook for 5 minutes until the liquid has been absorbed by the jackfruit.</li>
            <li>Add the sauce-cornstarch mixture until combined.</li>
            <li>Turn heat off and spread jackfruit on baking sheet. Bake for 12-15 minutes until jackfruit is tender.</li>
